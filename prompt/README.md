# Customization by oh-my-zsh
I usually use the base configuration of oh-my-zsh
all of this is in the official ![oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) repo and the default themes are in

'''bash
 ${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh 
'''

you can install it using `install.sh` script this script will install oh-my-zsh and copy my theme `${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh/theme` path
